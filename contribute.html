		<h2>Issues</h2>
		<hr class="sep10">

		<p>
			When <a href="https://github.com/matthiasmullie/scrapbook/issues/new">filing bugs</a>,
			try to be as thorough as possible:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>What version of Scrapbook did you use?</li>
			<li>What did you try to do? <i>Please post the relevant parts of your code.</i></li>
			<li>What went wrong? <i>Please include error messages, if any.</i></li>
			<li>What was the expected result?</li>
		</ul>

		<hr class="sep20">

		<h2>Pull requests</h2>
		<hr class="sep10">

		<p>
			Bug fixes and general improvements to the existing codebase are always welcome.
			New features are also welcome, but will be judged on an individual basis. If
			you'd rather not risk wasting your time implementing a new feature only to see
			it turned down, please start the discussion by
			<a href="https://github.com/matthiasmullie/scrapbook/issues/new" title="opening an issue">opening an issue</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Where applicable, new features should follow the existing model of wrapping them
			around a KeyValueStore object, which is in turn also a KeyValueStore. Like how
			an adapter can be wrapped inside a StampedeProtected, which can in turn be
			wrapped inside a TransactionalStore. This keeps functionality nicely isolated
			(single responsibility) while still offering a consistent API.
		</p>

		<p>
			Don't forget to add your changes to the <a href="https://github.com/matthiasmullie/scrapbook/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md" title="changelog">changelog</a>.

		<h2>Testing</h2>
		<hr class="sep10">


		<h3 class="headline">Running the tests</h3>
		<span class="brd-headling"></span>
		<div class="clearfix"></div>

		<p>
			To run the complete test suite, for all adapters:
		</p>

		<pre>vendor/bin/phpunit</pre>

		<p>
			Or a specific adapter (in this case Memcached):
		</p>

		<pre>vendor/bin/phpunit --group "Memcached"</pre>

		<p>
			Or a couple of adapters (in this case the SQL group):
		</p>

		<pre>vendor/bin/phpunit --group "MySQL,PostgreSQL,SQLite"</pre>

		<p>
			Some adapter rely on external services (cache server) & libraries (client-side
			APIs). If you need help to install these, take a look inside the
			<a href="https://github.com/matthiasmullie/scrapbook/blob/master/tests/.travis" title="tests/.travis directory">tests/.travis directory</a>, where the installation scripts for
			Travis CI are located.
		</p>

		<p>
			A lot of them use Docker to launch the cache servers but you can always install
			the servers natively, in which case you may need to alter the adapters
			configuration (e.g. because you're running the server on a different port). This
			configuration is located in <a href="https://github.com/matthiasmullie/scrapbook/blob/master/tests/Adapters" title="tests/Adapters">tests/Adapters</a>, in the <code>::get</code>
			method of every adapter. If you do need to alter these in order to run the tests
			on your machine, make sure not to commit those changes!
		</p>

		<p>
			Travis CI has been <a href="https://github.com/matthiasmullie/scrapbook/blob/master/.travis.yml" title="configured">configured</a> to run a matrix of all supported
			PHP versions & adapters individually. Upon submitting a new pull request, that
			test suite will be run & report back on your pull request. Please make sure the
			test suite passes.
		</p>

		<hr class="sep20">

		<h3 class="headline">Writing tests</h3>
		<span class="brd-headling"></span>
		<div class="clearfix"></div>

		<p>
			Please include tests for every change or addition to the code.
		</p>

		<hr class="sep10">

		<h4>New adapter</h4>

		<p>
			To add a new adapter, just add a new <i>AdapterName</i>Test.php file in the
			<a href="https://github.com/matthiasmullie/scrapbook/blob/master/tests/Adapters" title="tests/Adapters">tests/Adapters</a> directory, similar to the existing adapters.
			That file should implement AdapterInterface & <code>::get</code> should return that
			adapter's KeyValueStore implementation & throw a
			<code>MatthiasMullie\Scrapbook\Exception\Exception</code> in case it fails to initialize.
		</p>

		<p>
			These adapter tests can also include adapter-specific tests. Just look at
			<a href="https://github.com/matthiasmullie/scrapbook/blob/master/tests/Adapters/MemoryStoreTest.php" title="MemoryStoreTest.php">MemoryStoreTest.php</a>, for example.
		</p>

		<p>
			Make sure to remember to also include the adapter in <a href="https://github.com/matthiasmullie/scrapbook/blob/master/.travis.yml" title=".travis.yml">.travis.yml</a>
			and create an <a href="https://github.com/matthiasmullie/scrapbook/blob/master/tests/.travis" title="installation script">installation script</a> for Travis CI.
		</p>

		<hr class="sep10">

		<h4>Other new class</h4>

		<p>
			To create a new test that can be run for all adapters, make sure it extends from
			<a href="https://github.com/matthiasmullie/scrapbook/blob/master/tests/AdapterProviderTestInterface.php" title="AdapterProviderTestInterface">AdapterProviderTestInterface</a> and has a
			static function <code>::suite</code> that calls
			<a href="https://github.com/matthiasmullie/scrapbook/blob/master/tests/AdapterProvider.php" title="AdapterProvider">AdapterProvider</a>. Or just extend
			<a href="https://github.com/matthiasmullie/scrapbook/blob/master/tests/AdapterTestCase.php" title="AdapterTestCase">AdapterTestCase</a> directly, which has that already
			wired up.
		</p>

		<hr class="sep20">

		<h2>Coding standards</h2>
		<hr class="sep10">

		<p>
			All code must follow <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/" title="PSR-2">PSR-2</a>. Just make sure
			to run php-cs-fixer before submitting the code, it'll take care of the
			formatting for you:
		</p>

		<pre>vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix src
vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix tests</pre>

		<p>
			Document the code thoroughly!
		</p>

		<hr class="sep20">

		<h2>License</h2>
		<hr class="sep10">

		<p>
			Note that Scrapbook is <a href="license.html" title="MIT license">MIT-licensed</a>, which basically allows anyone to do
			anything they like with it, without restriction.
